## About

This tutorial uses the classic [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) dataset and demonstrates how to build models to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, you will provide the models with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

In this project, we will also explore the phenomenon of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). It is a scenario where the accuracy of models on the validation data would peak after training for a number of epochs and then stagnate or start decreasing. We will also explore several techniques (e.g. dropout, regularization etc.) to deal with Bias-Variance trade-off issue.
