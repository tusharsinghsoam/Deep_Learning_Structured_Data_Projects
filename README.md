## About

* This repository contains projects, solved using **Neural Networks**. 

* Aim of this repository is to learn the basics of neural networks, and how to define, train, evaluate and optimize them. I will also explore some popular deep-learning frameworks like **Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch**.

* Dataset sources will be mentioned in the README files of individual projects.

* The focus of the repository would be the application of Deep learning to structured data.

Feel free to collaborate or suggest any interesting project/Dataset.
